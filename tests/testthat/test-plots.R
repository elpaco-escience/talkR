# This test suite checks that the plots generated by this package make sense.
# It uses testthat::expect_snapshot_file. This is how it works:
#
# The first time expect_snapshot_file is run, it creates a reference image. An
# expert validates it manually, and it gets stored.
#
# Every other time expect_snapshot_file is run, it compares the output with the
# reference image. If the new and the reference image are identical, the test
# passes. Otherwise, it fails.
#
# When fail, testthat provides some useful tools to visualy compare the differences
# between new and reference image. They are clickable from the test menu.

# Load the test data
testdata <- get_ifadv()

#' Auxiliary decorator
#'
#' This decorator extends the functionality of any plotting function with:
#'
#' 1. Saving the plot to a png file
#' 2. Returning the path
#'
#' This is required by testthat::expect_snapshot_file to work with graphics.
